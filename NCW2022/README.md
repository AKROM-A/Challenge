As for the flag format, because the challenge itself consist of 4 different contract, and the last part
of the flag has the "}" included, the flag will look like this:  

For Example:  
flag 1 = ayamgoreng_itu_enak  
flag 2 = 1234567890  
flag 3 = ini_function  
flag 4 = ya_sisanya}  

following the flag format described in SOLAR.sol  
format flag = NCW22{1_2_3_4  

the final flag will look like this  
NCW22{ayamgoreng_itu_enak_1234567890_ini_function_ya_sisanya}
